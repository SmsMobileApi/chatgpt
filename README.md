Personalized Assistant

With the SMS Mobile API, you can connect a customized assistant to your mobile SMS system. Simply specify an assistant_id in the dashboard to tailor responses to a specific assistant profile, making it possible to define a unique style, tone, or personality for each interaction.
How to Set Up a Custom Assistant

    Log in to your SMS Mobile API dashboard.
    Locate the assistant_id setting: Define an assistant_id for ChatGPT to use when generating responses.
    Save your settings. Once configured, all SMS responses will be tailored according to the assistant profile associated with the specified assistant_id.

This feature enables you to set up different assistants for various tasks or user groups, offering flexibility in interactions and ensuring a personalized experience for your audience.

Example Use Cases:

    Customer Support Specialist: Define an assistant_id for an AI customer support agent that follows your brand’s support tone and knowledge base.
    Personalized Notifications: Set up an assistant for friendly reminders or custom notifications with a conversational style.
    Multilingual Interaction: Connect assistants that respond in different languages based on user preferences.

By defining your assistant_id, you unlock the potential for unique, personalized SMS interactions that enhance user engagement and streamline communication.
